Notes:
Evaluation of Results/Hypothesis:
- Results need to be validated beyond visual comparison with the published results of an existing literatureb or reproduced paper.
- Figures should have good resolution and labels should be readable.

After data analysis, extrapolating the most abundant molecular targets in the data as biomarkers of a particular condition is purely speculative unless there's network reconstruction in specific confounding factors in order to deal with bias which may have influenced the study outcomes.

As part of the methodological rigour, the following are preferred,
- Balanced dataset (men/women, african/non-african, old/young etc.)
- Different omic data types can be compared (depending on what the project is about)

To emphasize the methodological contribution of the study, these other possible validation approaches can be done:
- Crossing different studies in databases that are related to the condition being studied
- Sensitivity analysis
- Co-occurence network analysis

Use case or Novelty:
Since similar pipelines likely exist already, hightlight the specific use case(s) where this proposed solution is particularly relevant.
