Notes:
Evaluation of Results:
It's good to validate the results beyond visual comparison with the published results of an existing literature.
Figures should have good resolution and labels should be readable.

After data analysis, extrapolating the most abundant molecular targets as biomarkers of a particular condition is purely speculative without network reconstruction in specific confounding factors which could have influenced the study outcomes.

As part of the methodological rigour, the following are preferred,
- balanced dataset (men/women, african/non-african, old/young etc.)
- different omic data types can be compared (depending on what the project is about)

To emphasize the methodological contribution of the study, these other possible validation approaches can be done:
- Crossing different studies in databases that are related to the condition being studied.
- Sensitivity analysis.
- Co-occurence network analysis.

Use-case or Novelty:
Since similar pipelines likely exist already, hightlight the specific use-case(s) where this proposed solution is particularly relevant.
